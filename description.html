<h1>CS 307 Final Project: Apples to Oranges</h1>
<h2>Esther Choe</h2>

<p><b>Overview: </b>My project scene is inspired by the phrase "comparing 
    apples to oranges," so I decided to make a basketball game scene of 
    apples to oranges, with bunny spectators. 
    <a href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~echoe2/cs307-graphics-project-final/project.html">
        This is the link to the demo.</a></p>

<p>I used the following graphics concepts in my project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>hierarchial modeling</li>
    <li>material, lighting, and shading</li>
    <li>curved lines/surfaces</li>
    <li>textures and texture-mapping</li>
    <li>animation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Individual Objects</h2>
<h4>Gym Room Setting: </h4>
    <p>The gym floor, bleachers background, and ceiling 
        were produced from texture-mapping.</p>

<h4>Basketball Equipment</h4>
    <p>The basketball and the hoop/stand used texture-mapping on 
        geometry objects. Phong material was used for these objects
        to reflect light. The hoop's stand was created from three 
        cylinders, where the base used two different radii.</p>

<h4>Bunny</h4>
    <p>The bunny was made with hierarchial modeling using Phong. 
        The geometry objects were mostly spheres that were scaled.</p>

<h4>Apples and Oranges</h4>
    <p>The apples and oranges also used hierarchial modeling and Phong material. 
        The brown stem was made from Torus geometry and the green leaf was 
        from a Bezier curve of 16 points. The apple had two bezier leaves and 
        eyebrows, while the orange had one bezier leaf and glasses.</p>

<h4>Lighting</h4>
    <p>Ambient and Directional light were used to light the overall scene.</p>

<br>
<h2>Animation</h2>
<p>The animation consists of three moving objects: the scoreboard, the basketball,
    and orange player near the center. 
    The basketball is dribbled on the floor between the apple and the orange. 
    The orange moves in the z-direction, to bounce the ball back to the apple.
    While this occurs, the scoreboard is animated by rotating around the y-axis,
    displaying the score to the audience / players looking from down below.</p>
